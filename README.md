# Sarcasm-Detector
NLP based sarcasm detection model

This project seeks to develop a robust sarcasm detection model utilizing BERT, GloVe, and Word2Vec embeddings to enhance accuracy and effectiveness. It leverages CNNs, BiLSTMs, and attention models in conjunction with BERT, GloVe, and Word2Vec embeddings for training a robust sarcasm detection model.

The dataset used for this project is shown below:

This project also involves using BERT and fine tuning it to obtain sentence embeddings. Later several deep learning methods such as CNNs, BiLSTMs and Attention models are used on top of the word embeddings to train the model to check sarcasm.

The results obtained are shown below:
